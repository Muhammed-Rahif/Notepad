## 🧐 About

### Why I created ?

I love open source and its maintaining so much. But I wanted a minimal and simple project to attract newcomers and everyone in general to contribute to my next project.

That's when I think of windows notepad text editor. I used windows early, but now I use ubuntu, and ubuntu don't have notepad (have a text editor). So I decided to create a notepad (that's looks like the windows notepad) that is accessible for every platform, everyone. However the main goal was open sourcing.

### Helpful for ?

- Newcomers to open source
- Developer who are new to react and typescript
- For everyone who loves to use windows notepad

### Who can contribute ?

- Who is learning react and typescript or who already knows them both.
- Who have minimal and simple ideas relating to this project.
- Others who have interest
